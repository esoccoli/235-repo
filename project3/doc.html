    <h2>Process</h2>

    <p>
        My process for working on this project was breaking the project into many smaller parts, and working on one part at a time,
        and then moving to the next part once the current one is complete. For example, I started by doing the scene setup, which
        included creating all the scenes, and adding all necessary text and buttons to the scenes. After that, I started working on
        the game itself. For that, I started by making the paddle and getting it to move left and right smoothly with user input. Then,
        I started working on the ball, making it move around the screen and bounce off walls and the paddle. Once that was working sufficiently,
        I made the bricks, and added collisions between the ball and the bricks. After that, I implemented power ups. Once all of that was implemented,
        I went back and started fixing bugs that had came up while developing.
