    <p>
        Welcome to Brick Breaker! In this game, you control the paddle using the arrows or the A and D keys.
        Your goal is to use the paddle to keep the ball on screen, so that the ball is able to break all the bricks.
        If the ball falls below the bottom of the screen, you lose a life. If you run out of lives, the game ends.
        If you break all the bricks on the screen, you will advance to the next level. Try to complete as many levels
        as possible before running out of lives
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also a few simple power ups that will start appearing after the first level. These will be in the form
        of colored circles on the screen. A green circle is an extra life, and a yellow circle is a score multiplier.
        Power ups are activated as soon as the ball collides with them.
