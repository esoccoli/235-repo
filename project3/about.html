    <h1>Brick Breaker</h1>

    <h2>1. High Concept</h2>

    <p>
        This game will be a recreation of the classic game Atari Breakout, with some of my own additions.
        In addition to the regular functionality, I plan to have an infinite number of levels, with the goal
        being to last as long as possible. I also want to add various powerups that the player can collect to
        help them out.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Genre</h2>

    <p>
        This game falls into the genres of action and arcade
    </p>

    <h2>3. Platform</h2>

    <p>
        This game will be primarily designed for desktop, as the primary controls will be from keyboard input.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Story</h2>

    <p>
        This game will have infinite levels, and the only ending will be if the player runs out of lives or chooses to quit.
        The player's goal is to complete as many levels as possible. As the player completes more levels, they will have more
        opportunities to get power ups that will help them out.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Esthetics</h2>

    <p>
        The graphics style for this game will be simple shapes, with different shapes and colors indicating different
        things.
        I plan to use 8 bit sound effects in the game when various events happen. At the moment, I want to have sound
        effects for the following events:
    <ul>
        <li>A brick is broken</li>
        <li>Level is completed</li>
        <li>Life lost</li>
        <li>Powerup collected</li>
        <li>Game over</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>6. Gameplay</h2>

    <h3>Mechanics</h3>

    <p>
        In this game, the player will be able to move the paddle left and right to line it up with the ball so that the ball
        bounces off of it. The player will also be able to collect power ups by getting the ball to collide with the power
        up object, which will be randomly positioned on the screen between the paddle and the bricks. When the player collects a
        powerup, it has an effect that benefits the user in some way. These effects will trigger as soon as the power up is collected.
    </p>

    <h3>Control</h3>

    <p>
        The controls in this game will be keyboard controls
    </p>

    <h3>Player Onboarding</h3>

    <p>
        I plan to have a specific screen in the game that tells the user how the game works and what the controls are.
        This screen will be accessible from the main menu by clicking on a button.
    </p>

    <h3>Player Learning</h3>

    <p>
        In order to do well in this game, the player will need to learn how the ball bounces off the different objects
        in the game, because this will allow them to predict where the ball will go, so that they can move the paddle to
        the appropriate location before the ball gets there.

        The player will also need to learn about the different powerups in the game, which are as follows
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Score multiplier - adds 0.5 to the player's score multiplier, allowing them to gain points more quickly</li>
        <li>Extra life - gives the player an extra life</li>
    </ul>
