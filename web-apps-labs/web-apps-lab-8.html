            (not the entire car object) of those cars that are .year 2010 or newer. 
            Use Array.map() on the cars array:
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
            
            This will give you a few undefined values. Use Array.filter() to get rid of these 
            undefined values so that newerYearsOnly contains only years (Numbers)
            
            Hint: you could use Number.isInteger() or the typeof operator:
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isInteger
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
            
            You could do this additional filter on a separate filter on the different lines,
            or as a "one-liner" by chaining the method calls.
